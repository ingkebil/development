 Manifesto for Agile Software Development<br><br>
 We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:<br><br>
 <b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools.<br>
 <b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation.<br>
 <b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation.<br>
 <b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan<br><br>
 That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
